# PncEngine 
This will be an Adventure Graphic (or Point and Click) Asset, to make your own game in this genre. There's a lot work to do. I want a flexible, easy to use, and easy modificable asset. There are some assets in the market but i want to make something different, a fully customizable engine, with some tools like UnitTestings included, design patterns. And will be a cheap asset, in the dimension of the engine that will be. Besides, i dont want put tools that Unity already have, like camera movements (already Cine Machine asset do this very well). Either will be a translate tool, because the unity translate asset will be enough. By the way, i will facilitate wiki or video tutorials explaning the use of the engine tools, and besides other tools with free packages.
